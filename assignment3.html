        <h2 id="lineage">Lineage</h2>
        <p>
          The Samoyed has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.
          A genomic study of two dog specimens that are nearly 100 years old and obtained from the Nenets people on the Yamal
          Peninsula found that these are related to two specimens dated 2,000 years old and 850 years old, which suggests continuity
          of the lineage in this region. The two 100 year old dogs were closely related with the Samoyed breed, which indicates that
          the ancient arctic lineage lives on in the modern Samoyed dog. Samoyeds were used for hunting, herding reindeer, and
          hauling sledges for the Samoyede people in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Siberia. </a>

        <h2 id="app">Appearance and characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          The AKC Standard requires 45–65 pounds (20–29 kg) and 21–23.5 inches (53–60 cm) at the shoulder for males, and 35–50 pounds
          (16–23 kg) and 19–21 inches (48–53 cm) for females. The UK Kennel Club Standard requires 51–56 centimetres (20–22 in) for
          males, and 46–51 centimetres (18–20 in) for females. Similiar in size to the popular
          <a href="https://shepherdjade.github.io/assignment3.html">husky</a> breed. Samoyed eyes are usually black or brown and are
          almond in shape. Samoyeds
          with eyes of other colors like blue exist but are not allowed in the show ring. The Samoyed is in the "brown and black section"
          in its family, the Spitz family. Samoyed ears are thick and covered with fur, triangular in shape, and erect. They are almost
          always white but have a light to dark brown tint (known as "biscuit") to a greater or lesser extent. The tint is usually on the
          ears but can be visible on the whole body. The Samoyed tail is one of the breed's distinguishing features. Like the Alaskan Malamute,
          the tail is carried curled over the back; however, unlike the Alaskan Malamute, the Samoyed tail is held actually touching the
          back. It is not usually held in a tight curl, or held flag-like; it is usually carried lying over the back and to one side. In
          cold weather, Samoyeds may sleep with their tails over their noses to provide additional warmth. Almost all Samoyeds will allow
          their tails to fall when they are relaxed and at ease, as when being stroked or while eating, but will return their tails to a
          curl when more alert. Samoyeds have a dense, double layer coat. The topcoat contains long, coarse, and straight guard hairs, which
          appear white but have a hint of silver coloring. This top layer keeps the undercoat relatively clean and free of debris. The under
          layer, or undercoat, consists of a dense, soft, and short fur that keeps the dog warm. The undercoat typically sheds heavily once or
          twice a year, and this seasonal process is sometimes referred to as "blowing coat". This does not mean the Samoyed will shed only
          during that time however; fine hairs (versus the dense clumps shed during seasonal shedding) will be shed all year round, and have
          a tendency to stick to cloth and float in the air. The standard Samoyed may come in a mixture of biscuit and white coloring,
          although pure white and all biscuit dogs are common. Males typically have larger ruffs than females. While this breed is touted as
          "hypoallergenic", it does shed a fair amount and needs frequent grooming. While the breed may produce fewer allergens, care should
          be taken for severe allergies. Shed Samoyed fur is sometimes used as an alternative to wool in knitting, with a texture similar
          to angora. The fur is sometimes also used for the creation of artificial flies for fly fishing. Life expectancy for the breed is
          about 12–13 years. It is wise to note that they are much bigger in size than the average <a href="https://ananyatandel.github.io/assignment3.html">Pomeranian.</a>

        <h2 id="temp">Temperament</h2>
        <p>
          Samoyeds' friendly and affable disposition makes them poor guard dogs; an aggressive Samoyed is rare. Quite similiar in tempermant to an adorable little
          <a href="https://bokchoy22.github.io/assignment3.html">Corgi.</a> The breed is
          characterized by an alert and happy expression which has earned the nicknames "Sammie smile" and "smiley dog".
          With their tendency to bark, however, they can be diligent watch dogs, barking whenever something approaches their
          territory. Samoyeds are excellent companions, especially for small children or even other dogs, and they remain playful
          into old age. According to the Samoyed Club of America, when Samoyeds become bored, they may become destructive or start
          to dig. With their sled dog heritage, a Samoyed is not averse to pulling things, and an untrained Samoyed has no problem
          pulling its owner on a leash rather than walking alongside.

        <h2 id="health">Health</h2>
        <p>
          The breed can be affected by a genetic disease known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyed_hereditary_glomerulopathy#:~:text=Samoyed%20hereditary%20glomerulopathy%20(SHG)%20is,that%20of%20the%20human%20disease.">Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy,</a> a kidney disease. The disease is
          known to be caused by an X-linked dominant faulty allele and therefore the disease is more severe in male Samoyeds. Also known
          as hereditary nephritis, it is caused by a nonsense mutation in codon 1027 of the COL4A5 gene on the X chromosome (glycine
          to stop codon), which is similar to Alport's syndrome in humans.
