        <p>Hi! I am a Junior at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying Applied Math.
        In addition to math I love anything that has to do with art! Recently I've been into
        costume construction and digital art. I hope to be able to infuse art with my technical
        skills to make some really beautiful websites throughout this course.</p>
        <h3> The internet is <u>quite</u> wonderful </h3>
